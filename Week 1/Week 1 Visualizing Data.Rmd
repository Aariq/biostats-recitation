## Information

Office Hours:

- Avalon:
- Eric:

## Objectives

- Build a toolset to work with, explore, visualize, and analyze data
- Become familiar with resources to help learn more on your own
- Apply concepts learned in lecture to new situations
- Get the tools you need to work through homework assignments

## Expectations

- **Attendance** (Recitation is required)
- **Collaboration** 
    - Ask for help from your classmates
    - Ask your classmates if they need help
- **Experiment, play, and have fun with R!**
- **Tell us if we need to slow down!**


## Why R?

- Open source (free!)
- Vibrant, helpful, friendly community online
- Reproducibility of code vs. point-and-click
- Used in many data-science, statistics, and science jobs

## What is R? What is R Studio? {.small-code}

R is a programing language, but it's one that's designed to work interactively.
```{r}
x <- 25
```
That means I can run one line of code at a time, instead of having to write a whole *program*.
```{r}
x^2
```
This makes it easy to learn and debug


## What is R? What is R Studio?

R Studio is an integrated development environment, or IDE.  Think of R as a car's engine and RStudio as the car's dashboard.

R: Engine            |  RStudio: Dashboard

In this class we will always interact with R through RStudio, never directly.

## Tour of RStudio

# Review of [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) Lesson

## R as a calculator
```{r results='hold'}
5+5
12/2
44*15
10^10
```

## Variable Assignment
```{r results="hold"}
x <- 2
y <- 3
x + y
```
```{r results="hold"}
z <- "Hello"
z
```

## Functions
```{r results="hold"}
sqrt(25)
abs(-5)
round(1.522222, digits = 3)
```

## Commenting your code
Use "#" to add notes in your code
```{r}
x <- c(1, 3, 7) 
#the 'c()' function concatenates elements into a vector
x
mean(x) #this takes the mean of 'x'
```

# Getting Help With R

## `help()` / `?`

```{r results="hold"}
?round
#or
help(round)
```

## With RStudio Help Tab:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/helptab.png")
```

## Google R Help:

- Include "R" or "rstats" and the name of the function in your search
- Stack Overflow and blog posts can be good sources

## Help On Social Media:

- **Twitter**: **#rstats** and **#r4ds** (R for Data Science) are often very helpful
- The R community is usually *very* friendly to beginners.

## Come to office hours!

- *All* of the TAs for this course know R and use it for their work

# Extending R

## Packages

- Packages extend the capabilities of R
- Think of them like apps for a smartphone
- For example, the `abd` package contains all the datasets used in your textbook
- We will use `abd`, `ggplot2`, and `dplyr` heavily in this course
- Install R packages using the "Packages" tab in RStudio


## Install Packages

- Install `abd` and `ggplot2` now
    + Packages only need to be installed **once**
- Load packages with `library(package_name)`
    + Packages need to be loaded **once per R session**

## Exploring Data

- Today we'll be using a built-in dataset called `iris`
- What is the `iris` dataset?
    + (hint: use `help()`)
- Try `head(iris)`.
    + What does the `head()` function do?

## Iris Data

```{r eval=FALSE}
head(iris)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(head(iris))
```


## Visualize Data

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species, size = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point()
```

## The Grammar of Graphics

`ggplot2` is based on a data visualization framework called the "grammar of graphics"
The short version is:

> A statistical graphic is a mapping of **data** variables to **aes**thetic attributes of **geom**etric objects.

All plots require three parts:

1. `data`, which must be a data frame
2. A `geom`, which describes how the data are to be plotted (points, lines, boxplots, etc.)
3. `aes`, which describes the aesthetic mapping of variables to representation by the `geom`


## Aesthetic Mapping

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height = 4}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species, size = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point()
```

- What variable is mapped to `x`?
- What variable is mapped to `y`?
- What variable is mapped to `color`?
- What variable is mapped to `size`?

## ggplot2 Code

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height = 4, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length,
                 y = Sepal.Width,
                 color = Species,
                 size = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point()
```

- Find the `data`, the aesthetic mappings, and the `geom`
- Try changing them!

## Recreate plots in chapter 2 of abd

Sara wants the first week to be all about plotting

- stripcharts/jitter plots
- histograms
- faceting
- violin plots


## Week 1 Code Cheatsheet


function|purpose|example
--------|-------|-------
`help()`|get help on how to use a function| `help(geom_point)`
`library()`|load an already installed package|`library(ggplot2)`
`ggplot()`|set up a ggplot.  Data and aesthetic mappings go in this function|
`geom_*()`|Use `geom_*` functions to map aesthetics to geometry| `ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width)) + geom_boxplot()`


## R Notebooks

Your first homework uses an R Notebook document.  Today, you'll get a very brief orientation so you can complete the homework, but we'll go more into depth in the future.


## Make an R Notebook

- Start a new notebook with `File > New File > R Notebook`
- Take a look
- Click "Preview"

## R Notebook Anatomy

- YAML header
    + **Don't touch for now!**
- Code chunks
    + Grey background
    + Bounded by three backticks (don't edit these)
    + Edit code inside and type your own code to complete homework
    + You can test code by clicking the "play" button in a chunk
- "Prose"
    + Not evaluated as R code, just writing
    + Type your answers to questions in the white spaces
    
## "Knitting" an R Notebook

When you are finished with your homework, click the "knit" button and it should output a Word doc!  Print, write your name, and hand it in.
