# biostats-recitation
Course materials for recitation section of BIO132 at Tufts University, 2017.

This was the first year the course used R.  Previously it used SPSS.  This was also the first year for a required recitation section that contained lecture rather than just open hours for SPSS troubleshooting. Eric Scott and Natalie Kerr were responsible for creating all course materials in this repository.

Many of the data sets were taken from Analysis of Biological Data by Michael Whitlock. We provided students with .csv files, but these data sets are also available via the package `abd`.
